# auto_text_effect

## Description

A simple example of a text that auto completes on the screen. This example uses recursion + setTimeout to update text in real time. A speed input is used so that the user can control the speed of the text on the screen. The input goes from 1 (slowest) to 5 (fastest). The input has an eventlistner on it and the 300ms is divided by the inputs value to increase or decrease the text on screen.
